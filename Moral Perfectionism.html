<h1>Moral Perfectionism</h1>
<p>
Without an alternative, criticism leads
to a cycle of shaming more and more people.
This "acceptable" group gets shrinks because
efforts to recruit others into the in-group 
are seen as wasting time and resources.
Not seeing that without inclusion and conversion as
part of praxis you are winning liberation from...who?
--Because bigotry is intersectional.
--Because the left has no sense of unity.

The Online Left are stuck in a cycle of criticism without
actions that can be taken to replace toxic behavior.
We say "transphobia is bad" but often don't celebrate
what makes trans identity beautiful.

Since the online left are disjointed, hostile to any percieved slight
and unforgiving, they have trouble achieving real world results.
The online space becomes the only space to conquer.
The left may also lack power to change their circumstances
or would find it difficult to attempt to do so.

It's much harder to run a food bank than it is to criticise someone
running a food bank.

Thus praxis, by its very imperfect nature, leads
idealists and purists and purity testers to 
conclude that since perfect isn't possible,
nothing is worth the effort.

Criticism, even valid criticism, can lead to a dark place
because it has the same pitfalls as perfectionism.

Instead of celebrating the good of something, we focus
on preserving a Perfect Utopia often at the cost of 
creating the utopia.

Unfortunately, the world cannot be perfect, not that we
should stop trying to improve things.

The impossibility of the task does not excuse
a lack of trying to create it.

If criticism is the driving force for a movement,
then toxicity and negativity pervail.  Indeed, 
a person may hate the harm done to others.  They 
may believe absolutely in their cause. They may even be right.

While they are correct in their beliefs, 
their perfectionism
prevents them
from trying and thus 'good' can only exist in the abstract.

And in the abstract, any idea may work.

It is not "do not be idealistic".  It is "do not be perfectionistic".
It is not "the world contains shit so give up".  It is "our 
love of the good in this world must motivate us to do better".

When you love something, you try to understand it.  You listen
to its needs.  You give it autonomy.  You respect the power it has over
itself.  You respect its rights.

You don't just 'defend' it.  You don't just 'protect' it or 
try to controll it.  You let it do what it wants.
You let it be loved on its terms.  


In this way, utopianists hold themselves back.  They very nature of societal-perfection
becomes its own undoing.  Perfectionists can never be perfect because their ideal world is
unobtainable and perfectionism works as a sheild against criticism.
